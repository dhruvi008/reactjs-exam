Unlike Web 2.0 where data is controlled by tech giants, Web3 aims to give power back to users through decentralized applications (dApps). These applications run on peer-to-peer networks rather than centralized servers. Key areas seeing rapid development include decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). While still in its early stages, Web3 has the potential to fundamentally change how we interact online.",
